# Typical testors finding algorithms (Tyfa) library 

#### Description 
This library is for search all typical testors and equivalent concepts from different theoretical approaches:

- Typical testors form testors theory
- Reducts form rough set theory 
- Minimal traversals from hipergraph theory

#### Implemented algorithms

- YYC:
    * Yablonskii (Binary) testors
- FastBr:
    * Yablonskii (Binary) testors
- GCReduct:
    * Yablonskii (Binary) testors

#### Require:
* python >= 3.6
* matplotlib
* pytest-benchmark
