# Typical testors finding algorithms (Tyfa) library 

This library is for search all typical testors and equivalent concepts from different theoretical approaches:

- Typical testors form testors theory
- Reducts form rough set theory 
- Minimal traversals from hipergraph theory

Require:
* python >= 3.6
* pytest
* pytest-benchmark
